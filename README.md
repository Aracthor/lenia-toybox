# Lenia-Toybox

A Toybox made to undestand, experiment and watch cellular automata, starting from [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) to [Lenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenia).

Core made of C++ ported to WASM thanks to [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org), using OpenGL ES 3.0.
